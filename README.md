# 🎮 4D Chess - Four-Dimensional Chess Game

A mathematically rigorous implementation of four-dimensional chess on the discrete hypercubic lattice **{1,…,8}⁴**, built with **JavaScript** and **Three.js**.

## 📖 Overview

This project implements a complete framework for four-dimensional chess, extending classical chess mechanics into a 4D space. The system includes:

- **Mathematical formalization** using displacement sets in Z⁴ and Chebyshev adjacency
- **Complete game engine** with move generation, legality checking, and multi-king checkmate detection
- **Interactive 3D visualization** rendering all 64 (z,w)-slices simultaneously
- **Generalized chess rules** including castling, en passant, and promotion adapted for 4D

This implementation is based on the research paper: *"A Mathematical Framework for Four-Dimensional Chess"* by Rinaldi (Unciuleanu) Oana and Costin-Gabriel Chiru.

## 🎯 Mathematical Framework

### Board Structure

The 4D chessboard is defined as the set of integer lattice points **B = {1,…,8}⁴ ⊂ Z⁴**, where each coordinate axis corresponds to an independent spatial dimension:

- **Total positions**: 8 × 8 × 8 × 8 = **4,096 cells**
- **Total pieces**: **896 pieces** (448 per player) in the standard initial configuration
- **Visualization**: The 4D board is rendered as **64 distinct 8×8 boards**, each representing a fixed (z,w) slice

### Coordinate System

```javascript
Position = (x, y, z, w)
- X: Horizontal axis (0-7 in UI, 1-8 in theory)
- Y: Vertical axis (0-7 in UI, 1-8 in theory)  
- Z: Depth axis (0-7 in UI, 1-8 in theory)
- W: Fourth dimension (0-7 in UI, 1-8 in theory)
```

**Note**: The implementation uses 0-based indexing for UI convenience, while the mathematical framework uses 1-based indexing. Theoretical coordinates (x,y,z,w) correspond to UI coordinates (x-1, y-1, z-1, w-1).

### Initial Position

The standard starting configuration uses a quadrant-based layout across 64 (z,w)-slices:

- **Central boards** (4 slices): Both colors present, full 2D starting position
- **White-only boards** (24 slices): 16 white pieces per slice
- **Black-only boards** (24 slices): 16 black pieces per slice  
- **Empty boards** (12 slices): No pieces initially

This yields **448 pieces per side** (28 kings per side), distributed across multiple slices. Each slice containing a full 2D starting position includes one king per color.

### Adjacency and Movement

Two cells **p** and **q** are adjacent if their **Chebyshev distance** equals 1:

```
d∞(p,q) = max{|x-x'|, |y-y'|, |z-z'|, |w-w'|} = 1
```

An interior cell (not on any boundary) has exactly **3⁴ - 1 = 80 adjacent neighbors**.

## 📐 Piece Movement Rules in 4D

### Rook
- **Mobility**: Uniformly **28 moves** on an empty board (7 moves per axis)
- **Movement**: Linear along any single axis: (±d, 0, 0, 0), (0, ±d, 0, 0), (0, 0, ±d, 0), (0, 0, 0, ±d)
- **Graph structure**: Forms the Hamming graph H(4,8) with diameter 4

### Bishop
- **Mobility**: Position-dependent, up to **24 directions** in 6 coordinate planes
- **Movement**: Diagonal in any 2D coordinate plane (XY, XZ, XW, YZ, YW, ZW)
- **Parity invariant**: Preserves (x+y+z+w) mod 2, creating two connected components

### Knight
- **Mobility**: **48 moves** in the strict interior, reduced near boundaries
- **Movement**: Permutations of (±2, ±1, 0, 0) - "L-shaped" jumps in any 2-axis combination
- **Boundary sensitivity**: Degree depends on distance from board boundaries

### Queen
- **Mobility**: Union of rook and bishop moves
- **Movement**: Any rook move or any bishop move (32 total directions)
- **Restriction**: Deliberately limited to 1-axis and 2-axis moves (not 3-axis or 4-axis diagonals)

### King
- **Mobility**: **80 adjacent positions** in the interior
- **Movement**: One step in any direction: all cells with Chebyshev distance 1
- **Multi-king rules**: Each king is fully royal; losing any king ends the game

### Pawn
- **Orientation**: Each pawn has orientation **r ∈ {Y, W}** (forward axis)
- **Y-oriented pawns**: Move forward along Y-axis, capture in XY-plane
- **W-oriented pawns**: Move forward along W-axis, capture in XW-plane
- **Promotion**: Occurs at terminal boundary of forward axis (y=8 or w=8 for White)
